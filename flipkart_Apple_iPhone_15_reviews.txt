The BEST CAMERA PHONE OUT THERE, was in dilemma to buy s23 , but i chose this . And yes thats a wise decision , 60z is not a major con although it saves battery but 120 would be great. A16 is outstanding coupled with ios. In video quality nothing can beat it. Go for it for camera samples go with my uploaded photos one in daylight while other in night

Camera 🔥

Such a amazing phone 🫶🏻

It looks so good in my hand !.......WAU?

Writing this review after extensive usage. Hope it helps interested buyers decide.1. Display:- 4/5 (Great display but limited to 60Hz in 2023-24)2. Camera:- 4/5 (Great cameras but no telephoto at this price segment but this time Apple really nailed it with the 15 series 24mp shots are very sharp and detailed)3. Performance:- 5/5 (One of the fastest SOC available right now)4. Battery:- 3/5 (Average battery life also charger not included in the box and still charges slowly with the 20w bric...

Awesome

Just upgraded from iphone 12 to 15 and I totally loved this 15 series.Camera:- No doubt iphones camera are best of any other smartphone, primary camera is now 48mp which gives quite sharp images, 2x in portrait mode is definitely a game changer in base varient.Battery:- 3349 mAH is quite better as compared to older versions.Performance:- Apple improve performance by introducing A-16 bionic chip, no doubt performance is on top.Display:- In display we get dynamic island which gives phone mo...

using it as a secondary phone , got it at 61.5k including all the offers (except exchange) , great value for money phone , but yeah due to the lower refresh rate , you will less smoothness if you have used pro models before , still its  great..!

Loved it👍🏻. Great performance and not facing any kind of heating problem. Impressed by battery performance.

Camera is good but not too good like other camera phone.Performance is good but missed 90hz display.Battery is good enough for a day use.Sound is quite awesome like no other phonesRest phone is good to go for.

Thanks Flipkart I m glad such a beautiful iPhone 15

Love the performance 👍

I upgraded from iPhone 13 to 15 and this phone is awesome worth the money go for it

Just ok like any other premium android phone. Sound is just fantastic and face unlock feature is more convenient than fingerprint scanner. Battery backup is more than android 5000 mah battery. This is my frist iPhone, migrated from android due to chipset heating problem in Google tensor chip and Samsung exonys processsor.

Awesome phone ❤️

Awesome😍switch from android to iOS

I have been an Android phone user since  ever, until now.The matte frosting on the back is marvelous and doesn't attract fingerprints or smudges.I love the form factor as it's one hand friendly.For better gaming experience users should opt for the plus size.The screen is great with excellent outdoor visibility. The battery life is crazy good especially the standby time. Barely sips anything overnight. I am using an Android fast charger to charge this and the charging time is decent, no is...

Nice Colour

Nice device!

Superb... Shifted from Android to iPhone 15..classs👍

This is an amazing phone and back side of phone is frozen glass which makes it less prone to finger marks while holding. Till now enjoying it, will update with further details after a week.

Loved this product ❤️❤️

Design and performance is good. But somehow I felt the quality and standard is not the same as it used to be. It does heat up while charging and prolonged usage. This is unexpected and unacceptable. Also there are connectivity issues with Apple CarPlay.

Best in class Device, Apple never ceases to Amaze customers. Lightweight and sleek look. Matte back finish helps with a fine grip.

Awesome experience. thanks to flipkart

Good phone but display 60 hz very slow in 2023

Coming from iphone 12 mini.Camera is definitely a upgrade over the previous generation.Design outside remains the same. Pastel colours with matte finish.The Dynamic Island is what i liked for the notification part.Processor of previous generation pro models.Overall a value for money among the 15 models.Got it a great deal in flipkart clubbing exchange and bank offers.Delivery was on time.

Nice phone good

Really its the best and richest design 😍
